# Operating-System
For OS based simulation
A uniprocessor system has n number of CPU intensive processes, each process has its own requirement of CPU burst. The process with lowest CPU burst is given the highest priority. A late-arriving higher priority process can preempt a currently running process with lower priority. Simulate a scheduler that is scheduling the processes in such a way that higher priority process is never starved due to the execution of lower priority process. What should be its average waiting time and average turnaround time if no two processes are arriving are arriving at same time.
